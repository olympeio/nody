# Nody 

**Connect your tools to AI—securely, visually, and at scale.**

**Nody** is a developer-first platform designed to manage and deploy Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and toolsets. It enables seamless composition and deployment of your internal tools, APIs, and enterprise services to AI agents through an intuitive visual interface—no more hand-coding complex JSON configs.

🚀 Get started: [mcp.nody.dev/getting-started](mcp.nody.dev/getting-started)

## 🔧 Key Features 

- MCP Composer<br/>
  A powerful visual interface for composing, editing, and managing MCP servers and tool collections. 
- Tool Personalization<br/>
  Customize metadata, inputs, outputs, and documentation to optimize tool context for AI agents. 
- Stick & Scale<br/>
  Seamlessly expand MCPs by adding new tools without reconfiguring your stack.
- Enterprise Security _(Coming soon)_ <br/>
  Role-based access control and full audit logging across all MCP servers. 
- MCP Sharing _(Coming soon)_ <br/>
  Publish and share MCP configurations via public or private repositories with attribution. 

## 🏗️ Architecture 

- Graph-based backend using Neo4j for tool and relationship modeling. 
- Distributed execution layer powered by a Node.js runtime environment. 
- Orchestration and automation through [Olympe](https://www.olympe.io/) technology.

## 📖 How to use

Once your custom MCP is built on [Nody](mcp.nody.dev), you'll get a JSON content to copy into your favorite MCP client that looks like this:

```JSON
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<custom mcp name>": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@olympeio/nody-vmcp@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NODY_VMCP": "<custom MCP unique id>",
        "NODY_KEY": "<your very own secret encryption key>" // OPTIONAL, used when authenticated, required to use secret values
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will start the Nody MCP and load the list of tools that you inserted in the MCP edition panel.

### Override descriptions

In order to create MCP tailored to your need and better indicate to the AI what tool and how a tool should be used, you can set a custom name and/or description for each tool added into the custom MCP. 
This schema is used to announce to the LLM what tools are available. It offers you the opportunity to finetune these generic and vendor based descriptions according to your needs.
